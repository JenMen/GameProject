Jen's Game Idea:

My game will revolve around the reactions of the players as they make quick decisions. there will a series of questions that they will need to answer in a certain amount of time. The questions will be random. The story will something along the lines of escaping a villain that has captured you. You have to get through a series of locks and doors to escape. As you go through and complete a set amount of quizzes, you can gain perks like more time or a second try. In the end it will count the ones you got right, the ones you got wrong, and how long it took you to get out.
